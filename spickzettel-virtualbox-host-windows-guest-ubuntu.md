# increase disc size of a virtual machine when host is Windows 10 and guest Ubuntu while lvm is being used
	* check if lvm is used
		* command line
			cat /etc/fstab
			Watch the line with your root filesystem. The indicator for LVM would be somethinkl with /dev/mapper/....
		* gui
			Check the partitions with GParted. Partions with LVM will have the lvm flag.
	* Resize the disc size in Windows 10
		* Select the VM machine
		* Goto File > Virtual Media Manager
		* Choose the right virtual disc (VM Name.vdi or something similar)
		* Increase the disc size for the vm and the snapshoots to the desired size and apply it
	* Modifications in Ubuntu
		* Restart the vm
		* Use GParted to resize root parttion
		* reboot the system
		* make the lvm partitioning scheme aware of the changes made
			* as the root user run the commands
				* sudo su
				* pvs
					* check for the right partition XXX 
				* pvresize /dev/XXX
				* lsblk
					* Running lsblk shows that the root partition is still occupying only ZZZ whereas thereâ€™s YYY on the partition XXX. This is because our physical partition has grown but the logical volume manager is not aware of this.
				* enter lvm 
					* lvm 
					* lvm > lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/root
					* lvm > exit
				* resizefs /dev/ubuntu-vg/root
		* finally the space should be available
		* df -h
* resources
